# python-tune

The code defines a training pipeline for a causal language model using the Transformers library, which includes loading a dataset, preparing a pre-trained model for k-bit training using PEFT (Platform Engineering For Transformers), and fine-tuning it with the SFTTrainer. The code uses a variety of configuration objects to customize the training process, including a PEFT configuration object to apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to the model weights, and an SFT configuration object to specify the training hyperparameters. After training the model, the code generates text using it on a custom prompt.
